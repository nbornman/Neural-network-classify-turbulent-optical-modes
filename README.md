# Neural-network-classify-turbulent-optical-modes
This project contains the Python code for a custom neural network I wrote from scratch, mainly as a neat learning experience, while on a research visit at the University of Waterloo. The network was written to classify six types of paraxial optical modes (identified by a pair of integer values) traveling through atmospheric turbulence, from real experimental data. The three remaining files are processed TensorFlow record files containing the experimental data.
