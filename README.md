# Neural-network-classify-turbulent-optical-modes
This project contains the Python code for a custom neural network I wrote from scratch, mainly as a neat learning experience, while on a research visit at the University of Waterloo. The network was written to classify six types of paraxial optical modes (identified by a pair of integer values) traveling through atmospheric turbulence, from real experimental data. The zip file contains three remaining files, which are in turn processed TensorFlow record files of the experimental data (divided into training, test and validation sets).
